Week-9

DashBoard

Using LookerStudio I have done the following steps:

Step 1: Prepared the Data
Ensured the dataset, such as the fraud detection dataset, is clean and structured. As the is in a CSV file, I have uploaded it to Google Sheets for easier integration.
Step 2: Accessing Looker Studio
Logged in with my google account on to looker studio website.I have created a new report and added the data source to the new report and familiarized myself with the interface.
Step 3: Designed the Dashboard
Added Charts:I have started with a pie chart to show the distribution of target variable based on the gender,bar charts to display income distributions and scatter plot to explore relationships between numerical variables.
